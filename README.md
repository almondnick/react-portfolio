## Description

This portfolio was created using starter code from freecodecamp.org in an article linked below.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-portfolio-website-react/

This portfolio was created using ReactJS, tailwind, and freecodecamp.org's starting code. 

## Installation

Clone this repository and run npm i to get started on your own react portfolio.

## Usage

This portfolio displays an about me page with some projects I have completed and a way to contact me.

## Deployment

I am having trouble using Netlify to deploy this application. May have something to do with the starter code. I apologize for not providing a deployed application.

## Credits

Thanks to freecodecamp.org for providing a solid baseline on how to create a react portfolio. I used Stack Overflow and previous classwork to complete this project as well.
